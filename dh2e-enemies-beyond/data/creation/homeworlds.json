Chaos rules in these locations, and creatures of the Warp roam twisted landscapes made of nightmare and insanity. Those who live there are often reduced to amusing prey or tortured slaves for the Ruinous Powers, and survival is more than just staying alive—it is also a struggle to stay human."

Life on many penal colonies is extremely regimented and heavily monitored. Those who survive and emerge from this environment stronger and more defined are often the kind needed by both Inquisitors and the Imperial Guard."

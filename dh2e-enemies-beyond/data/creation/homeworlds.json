Chaos rules in these locations, and creatures of the Warp roam twisted landscapes made of nightmare and insanity. Those who live there are often reduced to amusing prey or tortured slaves for the Ruinous Powers, and survival is more than just staying alive—it is also a struggle to stay human.",

Should he gain this skill again in a later step of character creation, he instead gains one additional Rank in the skill. Note that he cannot purchase more Ranks of this skill unless he acquires the Psyker aptitude. This character also begins with 1d10+5 Corruption points.",

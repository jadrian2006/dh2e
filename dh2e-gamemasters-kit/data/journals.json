Among the victims they discover a xenos artefact and the body of Darnis Fayne. Investigation leads through the Carrion Guilds, the Drains, the Boneyard, and ultimately to the <strong>Fayne Mortuarius</strong>, where the Blessed Flesh cult operates in secret.</p>\n<h2>Part II: The Red Walk</h2>\n<p>Following the body trade trail downhive, the Acolytes pass through the Purity Gate into Gantry&mdash;a rogue settlement ruled by <strong>Vornas Crimson</strong> and his Red Walk gang. The Acolytes must navigate gang politics, the blood sports of the Knife Lock pit, and forge an uneasy alliance before the animated dead launch an assault on the settlement.</p>\n<h2>Part III: A Pestilent Heart</h2>\n<p>The Acolytes descend into the sump-swamp and wild Underhive ruins to reach the Blessed Flesh's lair&mdash;a massive archeotech construction platform rising from the toxic river. They must infiltrate the fortress, confront <strong>Ferrue Fayne</strong>, and stop the summoning ritual before <strong>Aynthrexes, Herald of Nurgle</strong>, is brought fully into reality.</p>",

It can be run as a standalone adventure with minimal adjustment.</p>\n<h2>Key Themes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Corruption and Decay:</strong> The physical rot of the Gallowsway mirrors the spiritual corruption of the Blessed Flesh cult. Even the dead are not allowed rest.</li>\n<li><strong>Body Trade:</strong> The Carrion Guilds process thousands of corpses daily. Ferrue has corrupted this system, stealing bodies for reanimation and selling organs to the underhive.</li>\n<li><strong>Nurgle's Embrace:</strong> The adventure builds from a mundane murder investigation into a confrontation with daemonic forces. Each act escalates the Warp taint.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Using This Adventure with Dark Pursuits</h2>\n<p>This adventure can be used as a sequel to <em>Dark Pursuits</em>, the scenario found in the Core Rulebook. Dark Pursuits deals with the trafficking of xenos artefacts within Hive Desoleum, and can easily be connected via the xenos artefact Ferrue has acquired. It is likely that Ferrue has had dealings with the Trade Sable, and some NPCs from Dark Pursuits might have passed his name onto the Acolytes.</p>\n<h2>Starting Characters</h2>\n<p>Recommended starting XP: <strong>1000&ndash;2000 XP</strong>. New characters can handle the early investigation, but the final confrontation with Aynthrexes is extremely dangerous for inexperienced Acolytes.</p>",

These enemies, referred to as <strong>Nemeses</strong>, can drive the plot of a campaign with their machinations, while finally confronting them provides an extremely satisfying showdown.</p>\n<h2>Who is the Nemesis?</h2>\n<p>The nature and origin of the Nemesis heavily informs the details of its plans and actions. Most Nemeses can be placed into one of three broad classes:</p>\n<h3>The Enemy Within</h3>\n<p>Traitors, heretics, and other malcontents within the Imperial structure make excellent Nemeses. Power-mad conspirators among the Imperium's elite are just as viable as low-life cultists. An entire group can serve as a Nemesis, such as a Chaos cult with a particularly great unity of purpose. The epitome of this sort of Nemesis could be another Inquisitor working at odds to the Acolytes' own master.</p>\n<h3>The Enemy Without</h3>\n<p>Alien threats frequently draw Inquisitorial notice. For an alien menace to work as a Nemesis, it should ideally be capable of subtlety and indirect action. The most iconic example is the enigmatic Eldar&mdash;Farseers who act ruthlessly upon any perceived threat, laying schemes over multiple human generations. Dark Eldar Archons, Tau Water Caste diplomats, and even Ork Warlords of unusual cunning can serve as Nemeses with the right approach.</p>\n<h3>The Enemy Beyond</h3>\n<p>Daemons and the servants of the Ruinous Powers represent threats of a fundamentally different nature. A daemonic Nemesis need not take the field personally; it can act through cults, possessed individuals, and corrupted artefacts. The greatest challenge of a daemonic Nemesis is its persistence&mdash;destroying a daemon's physical form merely banishes it temporarily.</p>",

                    "content": "<h2>Developing the Nemesis</h2>\n<p>A Nemesis should evolve as the campaign progresses. Early encounters should establish the Nemesis as a credible threat and hint at greater plans. The GM should consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> What drives the Nemesis? Power, revenge, ideology, or alien imperatives? The motivation should be consistent and understandable, even if reprehensible.</li>\n<li><strong>Resources:</strong> What does the Nemesis command? Cults, gangs, xenos technology, daemonic pacts? Resources should grow or diminish based on the Acolytes' actions.</li>\n<li><strong>Methods:</strong> How does the Nemesis operate? Through proxies, direct confrontation, manipulation, or corruption? The methods should reflect the Nemesis's nature and resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nemesis Encounters</h2>\n<p>Not every encounter with the Nemesis needs to be a direct confrontation. Consider these encounter types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Signs and Portents:</strong> Evidence of the Nemesis's activities&mdash;crime scenes, corrupted areas, terrified witnesses.</li>\n<li><strong>Proxy Conflicts:</strong> The Acolytes face the Nemesis's agents, servants, or creations.</li>\n<li><strong>Near Misses:</strong> The Acolytes arrive just too late, finding the Nemesis has moved on but left clues.</li>\n<li><strong>Direct Confrontation:</strong> A face-to-face encounter, which should feel earned after building tension.</li>\n<li><strong>The Final Showdown:</strong> The climactic battle, which should carry real stakes and consequences.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nemesis Survival</h2>\n<p>A good Nemesis should have plausible escape routes built into early encounters. Teleportation, body doubles, pre-planned bolt holes, or simply being too powerful to defeat at the Acolytes' current level are all valid approaches. However, the Nemesis should never feel truly invulnerable&mdash;the Acolytes should always feel that with enough preparation and the right circumstances, they can bring their enemy down.</p>",

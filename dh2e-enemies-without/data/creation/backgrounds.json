        "description": "Not all followers of the Omnissiah walk the prescribed paths of knowledge laid down by the ancient doctrines of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Some are driven by curiosity or ambition to explore forbidden avenues of techno-arcana, delving into proscribed technologies and xenos devices that their more orthodox brethren would condemn as heretical. These hereteks, as they are known, risk much in their pursuit of understanding—discovery by the Mechanicus means death or worse. Yet their unorthodox expertise makes them invaluable to Inquisitors of the Ordo Xenos, who often require someone capable of analysing alien technology without the constraints of Mechanicus dogma. A heretek's skills with technology are formidable, their knowledge broad and unconventional, though the price of their expertise is often a certain moral flexibility that can unsettle more pious companions.",

Crew members of Rogue Trader fleets are exposed to alien cultures, exotic technologies, and the wonders and horrors of the galaxy's fringes in ways that most Imperial citizens could never imagine.

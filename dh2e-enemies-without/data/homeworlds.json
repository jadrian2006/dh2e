Carnivorous plants, venomous creatures, toxic atmospheres, extreme temperatures, and constant geological instability are all common features. Those humans who survive on such planets do so through constant vigilance, brutal pragmatism, and the kind of toughness that can only be forged through a lifetime of struggle against an environment that actively seeks to kill them. Death worlders make superlative scouts, survivalists, and warriors, as years of dodging predators and enduring hardship have honed their reflexes to a razor's edge. They tend to be suspicious and taciturn, trusting no one and nothing—traits that serve them well as Acolytes of the Inquisition.",

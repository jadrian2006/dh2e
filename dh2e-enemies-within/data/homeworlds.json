The Adeptus Administratum classifies planets to this task often based on the desirable climates, native livestock, or other natural factors. On other agri-worlds, artificial aspects dominate, such as sheltered hydroponic lakes, floating fields suspended in hollowed-out planetoids, or algae vats buried deep within irradiated mountains. In all cases, their populations are devoted to a single cause: feeding the Imperium. Even the slightest crop failure or livestock plague can doom other worlds to horrific starvation or collapse an Imperial warfront, thus making their often-overlooked efforts vital for humanity's survival.",

On many of these worlds, gunpowder-based devices represent the extent of advancement. The other defining aspect of feudal worlds is how their natives live, all part of networks of obligations and allegiances throughout a tribe or other societal grouping. These ties remain throughout generations, all members born, raised, and dying within their fixed stations. Like their technology, feudal worlders exist in a stagnated state. In many ways their society is similar to the Imperium itself, a welcome familiarity after the shock many natives of such worlds face as they become aware of the wider society of Mankind.",

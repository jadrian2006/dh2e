There they received the Light of the Emperor, filling them with terrible purpose to defy the tyrant who had taken control of the Ecclesiarchy. The all-female Daughters were deemed exempt from the Decree Passive, and became the Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas\u2014a powerful presence to ensure the will of the Ecclesiarchy was enacted faithfully. The fierce devotion of the Sisters to their Emperor has ended many a threat from within the Imperium since those dark days. No heretic can stand against their zeal in enacting the judgement of the Ecclesiarchy, but the Sisters have also grown into a number of Non-Militant Orders devoted to the healing arts, communications, and diplomacy. In all ways, though, they are supremely loyal to the Emperor, utterly incorruptible and ready to purge all heresies with hymns and fire.",
